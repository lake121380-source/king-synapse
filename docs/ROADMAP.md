Status

Architecture: **Stable**

Adaptive Common Model: **Frozen**

Algorithm: **In Progress**

Current focus

▶ RFC-015 — Hebbian Algorithm

Phase 5 shifts from shared-contract work to independent algorithm work. RFC-011 (Adaptive Common Model) is now frozen. RFC-012 through RFC-015 (Reflection, Merge, Forget, Hebbian) consume RFC-011 as read-only ground truth and MUST NOT extend it. Algorithm RFCs are also independent of one another — each depends only on RFC-011.

Phase 2 concluded with `v0.2.0-recall-api-freeze`. The Recall contract is now considered stable. Future work extends the platform rather than redesigning it.

Phase 3 concluded with `v0.3.9-memory-evolution-freeze`. The Memory Evolution contract layer is now considered stable. Future work should extend these interfaces instead of changing them.

P4.1 concluded with `v0.4.9-adaptive-memory-foundation`. The Adaptive Memory execution model is now considered stable. Future behavior modules should reuse the Plan -> Execute -> Report -> Sink shape.

P4.2 concluded with `v0.4.19-reflection-processing-freeze`. Reflection Processing is now contract-frozen and remains deterministic and side-effect free.

P4.3 concluded with `v0.4.29-hebbian-execution-freeze`. Hebbian Execution is now contract-frozen and remains deterministic and side-effect free.

P4.4 concluded with `v0.4.39-store-integration-freeze`. Store Integration is now contract-frozen and defines the canonical persistence boundary for Phase 4 behavior modules.

P4.5 concluded with `v0.4.49-adaptive-policies-freeze`. Adaptive Policies is now contract-frozen. Phase 4 is complete.

v0.5.0 concluded with `v0.5.0-architecture-freeze`. The whole-project public API is now stable under the compatibility policy in `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`. Development mode shifts from **Contract-first** to **Algorithm-first**.

v0.5.9 concluded with `v0.5.9-adaptive-common-freeze`. RFC-011 is Implemented. The Adaptive Common Model (Importance, Event, Event Stream, Context, Metric, Report) is now frozen. Every subsequent algorithm RFC (RFC-012..015) depends only on RFC-011.

## Phase 5 — Algorithm Implementation

Goal

Turn the frozen contracts into concrete adaptive behavior without changing any stable API.

Focus

- RFC-012 Reflection Algorithm — freeze-review the rule-based heuristic and production-grade benchmarks.
- RFC-013 Merge Algorithm — freeze-review merge lifecycle behavior and harden production benchmarks.
- RFC-014 Forget Algorithm — freeze-review forget lifecycle behavior and harden production benchmarks.
- **RFC-015 Hebbian Algorithm** — freeze-review the rule-based heuristic, multi-step graph activation path, edge persistence, execution adapter, latent inspection path, and benchmark before the next freeze tag.
- Evaluation & benchmarks (DMR, LongMemEval, comparisons against Graphiti / Letta / Mem0).
- Parameter sweeps and ablation studies.

Rules

1. Phase 5 must not change any Stable API. All work plugs in behind existing traits.
2. Frozen benchmark baselines (`reference` `Recall@10 = 1.000`, `multihop` `Recall@10 = 1.000` after ADR-006) must be preserved or explicitly renegotiated through ADR.
3. Every concrete algorithm ships with a benchmark run demonstrating baseline preservation and target-metric improvement.
4. Algorithm parameters are internal by default; promotion to Stable API requires an ADR.
5. Post-freeze rules of RFC-011 apply: uniform call shape `fn method(&self, target, ctx)`, no new top-level shared types under `adaptive/`, algorithm RFCs are independent of one another, `AlgorithmContext` never owns data, benchmarks use only public API, renaming a frozen type is breaking.

## Phase 3 Contract

> **Phase 3 must not modify the Recall contract unless an ADR explicitly approves the change.**

Rules

1. `RecallHit` schema remains frozen.
2. `RecallBoosters` are the only extension point for recall scoring.
3. Every recall-related behavior change must preserve or improve benchmark results.

## Phase 3 — Memory Evolution

Status

Architecture Complete / Contract Frozen

Goal

Enable memories to evolve over time without changing the Recall Platform.

## Phase 4 — Adaptive Memory

Contract rules

1. Do not change Phase 2 Recall contracts without ADR approval.
2. Do not change Phase 3 Memory Evolution contracts without ADR approval.
3. Prefer strategy implementations over interface changes.
4. Preserve `reference` and `multihop` benchmark baselines before merging behavior changes.
5. Start each Phase 4 implementation from an RFC.
